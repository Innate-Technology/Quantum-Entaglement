# Quantum-Entaglement

Quantum entanglement is used in Quantum Wireless Technology to establish secure communication between the two parties. The basic idea is to use entangled particles to create a shared random string of bits that can be used as a key for encoding and decoding messages.

Here's how it works:

1. Preparation: The sender and receiver share a source of entangled particles, such as photons. The photons are entangled in such a way that the state of one photon is correlated with the state of its partner.
2. Key Generation: The sender and receiver both measure the state of their respective entangled photons, which generates a random string of bits. These bits form the key that will be used to encode and decode messages.
3. Encoding: The sender uses the key to encode a message, which is then transmitted to the receiver.
4. Decoding: The receiver uses the same key to decode the message, since only the sender and receiver know the key and are able to use it to encode and decode messages.
The use of entangled particles in this process ensures the security of the key and the privacy of the message. Because of the laws of quantum mechanics, it is impossible for an eavesdropper to obtain any information about the key or the message without introducing detectable errors.

In this way, quantum entanglement provides a way to establish secure communication in a wireless setting, without the need for a secure physical connection. This makes it particularly useful for situations where a secure communication link is needed but a wired connection is not practical or available.

Quantum entanglement is a concept in quantum mechanics that describes the correlations that exist between the properties of two or more quantum systems, even when they are separated by large distances. The correlation is so strong that measuring the state of one system instantaneously affects the state of the other system, regardless of the distance between them. This phenomenon was first described by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen in their 1935 paper "Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality be Considered Complete?" and has since been verified experimentally.

In an entangled system, the individual quantum systems are said to be "entangled" with one another, meaning that their properties are not independent but instead are correlated in a way that cannot be explained by classical physics. The correlation is described by what is known as a "quantum state," which specifies the probabilities for the values of the various properties of the system.

One of the most famous and easily understood examples of entanglement is the concept of "spooky action at a distance." This refers to the fact that the state of one entangled particle can instantaneously affect the state of its partner, even when they are separated by large distances. This phenomenon is so strange and counterintuitive that Einstein famously referred to it as "spooky action at a distance."

Quantum entanglement has a number of applications in the field of quantum information, including quantum cryptography, quantum teleportation, and quantum computing. The correlations present in entangled systems can be used to transmit information securely, to teleport quantum states from one location to another, and to perform certain types of computation that are much faster than what is possible with classical computers.
